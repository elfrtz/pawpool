# The Solution

**PawPool** unlocks the value of NFTs through a **trustless, peer-to-peer lending protocol.** By using smart contracts, PawPool allows NFT holders to **borrow APT without selling their NFTs**, and gives lenders a secure way to **earn yield** backed by on-chain collateral.

Here's how it works:

### :closed\_lock\_with\_key: NFTs Stay in the Borrower's Wallet, But Are Frozen

When a borrower requests a loan, their NFT is locked via smart contract. It can’t be listed, transferred, or sold. It remains visible in their wallet but unusable until the loan is repaid or defaulted.

### :handshake: Loans are Peer-to-Peer

Borrowers define their own loan terms (amount, duration, APY). Lenders choose which requests to fund.

### :repeat: Default = Automatic NFT Transfer to Lender

If the borrower fails to repay on time, the smart contract **automatically transfers the NFT to the lender** — no mediation required.

### :dog: $GUI Utility Layer

Borrowers who repay with $GUI get discounted interest rates. Lenders who stake $GUI get priority visibility or boosted rewards.



By locking NFTs without removing them from the wallet, PawPool offers a **trustless, composable, and community-driven way to unlock capital** — without giving up ownership.
