# $GUI Utility

PawPool is built for the GUI INU community and $GUI isn't just a vibe. It plays a real role in how you interact with the protocol.

While APT is the core lending currency, $GUI serves as an **incentive layer**, unlocking perks, rewards, and visibility boosts across the platform.

## For Borrowers: Repay with $GUI to Save Interest

When listing a loan or repaying an active one, borrowers can choose to repay the **interest portion** of their loan using $GUI instead of APT.

:white\_check\_mark: Get a **discount** on the interest rate (e.g., pay 20% less)

:white\_check\_mark: Automatically create demand for $GUI via repayment utility

:white\_check\_mark: Keep more of your APT while still closing out the loan

> Example: If your loan interest is 1 APT, you may only need to pay 0.8 APT worth of $GUI.

This model gives $GUI real use beyond speculation while keeping the lender’s payout in APT (so they’re never affected).

## For Lenders: Boost Visibility with Staked GUI

Lenders who stake $GUI can:

### 🚀 Priority Visibility

Your offers appear higher in borrower dashboards, increasing the chance of being matched quickly.

### 📈 Boosted APY Multiplier

Earn an additional yield multiplier (e.g., **+5% APY bonus**) when funding loans with active $GUI staking.

> Example: If a loan offers 12% APY, and you’ve staked $GUI, you may receive 12.6% or 13% instead.

### 🎁 Eligibility for Future Rewards

Lenders using $GUI may receive:

* Loyalty drops
* Leaderboard bonuses

:warning:  **Notes:**

All $GUI perks are **optional** — core protocol functionality remains open to all.

Boosted APY and discounts may be subject to caps or cooldowns
