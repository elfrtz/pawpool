# Borrow

PawPool allows you to unlock instant liquidity from your NFT without selling it.

As a borrower, you can list your verified Aptos NFT as collateral, define your loan terms, and receive APT when a lender accepts your offer. Your NFT stays in your wallet, but is **frozen** by the protocol â€” meaning it can't be listed, sold, or transferred during the loan period.
