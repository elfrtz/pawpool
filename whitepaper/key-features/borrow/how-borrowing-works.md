# How Borrowing Works

Here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how borrowing works at PawPool.

### 1. Connect Your Wallet

PawPool will automatically detect which NFTs in your wallet are part of supported collections.

### 2. Choose an NFT to Collateralize

Select one from your eligible NFTs. Each collection has a dynamic Loan-to-Value (LTV) suggestion based on floor price.

### 3. Set Loan Terms

Define:

* Loan Amount (APT)
* Loan Duration (e.g., 3, 7, or 14 days)
* Interest Rate (APY%)

### 4. List Your Loan Request

Once submitted, your NFT is **frozen** on-chain.

* It remains in your wallet, but cannot be transferred, bridged, or listed on marketplaces.

Your loan request becomes visible to lenders.

### 5. Loan Funded? Receive APT Instantly

If a lender accepts your offer, your requested APT is deposited into your wallet immediately.

Loan countdown begins.

### 6. Repay Before Deadline

Repay the principal + interest on or before the deadline to unfreeze your NFT and retain ownership.

### 7. Fail to Repay? NFT Transfers to Lender

If the loan duration ends without repayment, the NFT is automatically transferred to the lender via smart contract enforcement.
