# Lend

Lending on PawPool is simple, transparent, and powered by NFTs.

As a lender, you can browse loan requests from verified NFT collections on Aptos, fund the ones that meet your risk appetite, and earn APT or GUI from interest or receive the NFT if the borrower defaults.

There are no pools, no intermediaries. Just clean, peer-to-peer finance with smart contracts handling all the logic.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Risks to keep in mind:**

* If the borrower defaults, you’ll receive the NFT — not your APT.
* The value of that NFT may fluctuate based on market floor price and demand.
* Only lend what you’re willing to accept as either yield or asset transfer.
