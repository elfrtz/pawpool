# Create Lending Offers

In addition to browsing borrower-created loan requests, PawPool allows you to create **lender offers** for specific NFT collections.

This lets you set your own loan terms and wait for borrowers who match your offer, flipping the dynamic while still keeping everything trustless and on-chain.

## How It Works

### 1. Choose a Verified Collection

* Select from whitelisted Aptos NFT projects.

### 2. Set Your Terms

* Choose:
  * Loan Amount (APT)
  * Interest Rate (APY%)
  * Duration (in Days)

### 3. Publish Your Offer

* Your offer is posted to the public lending pool for that collection.
* It remains available until:
  * A borrower accepts it with an eligible NFT, or
  * You cancel it manually.

### 4. Matched? Protocol Handles the Rest

* Once matched, your funds are automatically escrowed and sent to the borrower.
* Repayment and liquidation logic is handled just like borrower-initiated loans.

## Why Use Collection-Based Lending Offers?

### Set Your Own Risk Parameters

Control how much you're willing to lend, and for how long.

### Let Borrowers Come to You

It saves time. No need to scout for listings if you already know what NFTs you're comfortable backing.

### Boost Visibility with $GUI

Offers backed by staked $GUI may appear higher in borrower dashboards or earn priority matching during launch phases.
