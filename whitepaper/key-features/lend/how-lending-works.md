# How Lending Works

### 1. Browse Active Loan Requests

* Loan requests are created by NFT holders who want to borrow APT.
* Each listing shows the NFT, requested amount, APY, loan duration, and time left to fund it.
* You can filter by collection, yield %, loan size, or duration.

### 2. Review the Collateral

* All loans are backed by Aptos NFTs that have been manually verified by the protocol.
* While the NFT stays in the borrower’s wallet, it is **frozen** via smart contract, meaning it can’t be transferred, listed, or bridged during the loan period.

### 3. Fund the Loan

* If you accept a loan offer, your APT is transferred into the protocol contract.
* The borrower immediately receives the funds, and the loan countdown begins.

### 4. Earn Yield or Receive the NFT

* If the borrower repays on time, you’ll receive your full principal + interest automatically.
* If the borrower defaults, the smart contract will transfer the NFT **directly to your wallet.**
