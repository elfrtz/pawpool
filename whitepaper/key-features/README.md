PawPool is built to be simple on the surface, but powerful under the hood.

Our goal is to bring **NFT-backed lending** to Aptos in a way that's secure, permissionless, and fun, while respecting the culture of the communities we serve. Below are the core features that make PawPool a unique entry point for NFT holders, lenders, and $GUI ecosystem participants.

Whether you're looking to **borrow APT without selling your NFT**, or **earn yield on idle capital**, PawPool offers a trust-minimized platform with intuitive flows and on-chain enforcement.
