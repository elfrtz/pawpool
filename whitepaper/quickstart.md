# Problem Statement

While NFTs have gained massive traction in the Web3 space, they remain one of the most illiquid assets in crypto. NFT holders often find themselves **forced to sell** their assets to access liquidity, even when they believe in the long-term value of their collectibles.

DeFi lending platforms have matured for fungible tokens, but **NFT-backed lending infrastructure on Aptos is still missing**.

There is currently:

* No secure, on-chain way to borrow against NFTs.
* No passive, yield opportunity for lenders using NFTs as collateral.
* No playful, meme-aligned experience for communities like GUI INU to participate in NFT-based finance.

The result?

NFT holders are left-out of DeFi, lenders have untapped capital, and NFT utility remains underdeveloped on Aptos.
